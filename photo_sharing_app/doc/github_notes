**Don't push alone!!**

**Don't work in the master branch!**
====================

Pushing to master:

On your branch, add files and commit them.

Change to branch master using:

    git checkout master

then merge:

    git merge yourbranchname

then pull:

    git pull

then push:

    git push origin master  

========================

Synching your branch and your clone of the master branch with origin master:

In master branch:

    git pull

And your clone of master is up to date!

Then switch to your branch with:

    git checkout yourbranchname

Then:

    git merge master

And you are done. Hooray!
