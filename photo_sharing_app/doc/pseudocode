pseudocode

photo#show

====================

change to haml

=====================

-photo name

-image

-tag

-upvote, downvote

-edit and delete buttons visible to user that owns the photo only

-write comment option, drops down a box to fill in

- show commments


footer - username's photo, album name

=======================

Going to make the comments bit first since that seems like the most fun part.

Need to:

  add a form for adding a comment using rails

  add the show comments part.

  then hide the form and make it appear with javascript.
